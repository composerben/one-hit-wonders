As a musician who's purchased more sample libraries than he cares to admit, and who's grown frustrated at not getting to try the samples before I bought them, 
I decided to create a solution. Built with drum samples in mind, One-Hit-Wonders allows for the creation of a kit a drump samples, let's you listen to the samples 
created by other users, and also contains a playable drum kit, so you can try the samples out for yourself with having to buy them, download them, or even leave
the site!
